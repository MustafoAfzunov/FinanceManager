Error Handling

**All API endpoints respond with appropriate HTTP status codes, and the error responses are structured as follows:**

**{
  "error": "Error message describing the issue"
}**

**Notes:**

    All endpoints that require authentication (like getting balance, adding expenses or incomes) assume that the user is logged in and has a valid authentication token.
    You may need to include an Authorization header with a Bearer token in requests that require authentication.
